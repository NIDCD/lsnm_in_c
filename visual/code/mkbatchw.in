line 1:
	directory of where you want the final data to be moved to
line 2:
	parameters in line 2:
	m,	ggns_in, seed,	lefthi, leftlo rightlo

	m: number of input files for right brain
	ggns_in: number of "on" blocks in the left brain's ggns input.  
	ggnsseed: The code mkinput  will use this number to randomly select 
          which block is turned on.  If seed = 0, system clock is the seed

 	attention parameters are:

	lefthi -- for left brain
	leftlo -- for left brain during intertrial period, if lefthi=leftlo, 
          left side has sustained attention
	rightlo-- for right brain during intertrial period
	righthi steps thru "start_a" to "end_a" at an increment of "inc_a"
	if increment = 0, only the start value will be used, and only once.
 
	The attention levels are entered as integers.
	e.g. if we want an attention level of 0.05, we enter 5.
	This input will be converted to the proper unit in the code
	We want integer entries because when we generate directory for a
	subject with attention level 0.05, we will name that directory b05.
	It is necessary to keep the directory names to be of the same length
	so we can use petmanip.m later for data manipulation

line 3: 
start_c  end_c  inc_c  start_a  end_a  inc_a

where suffix:
_c ==> fraction of the connection strength in the connected network (in %)
	e.g. 40 ==> 40% of conneciton strength
       note that capacity < 99
_a ==> attention level, 8 ==> attention level is 0.08
      note that attn < 50

All parameters are entered as integers.  They will be converted to proper
values in the code
if any of the inc's is 0, we do only the start value
