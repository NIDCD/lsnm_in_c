line 1:  
	directory of where you want the final data to be moved to
line 2:
	parameters in line 2:
	m, ggns_in, seed, lefthi, leftlo, rightlo

	m: number of input files for right brain
	ggns_in: number of "on" blocks in the left brain's ggns input.  
	ggnsseed: The code mkinput  will use this number to randomly select 
          which block is turned on.  If seed = 0, system clock is the seed

	attention parameters are:

	lefthi -- for left brain
	leftlo -- for left brain during intertrial period, if lefthi=leftlo, 
          left side has sustained attention
	rightlo-- for right brain during intertrial period
	righthi steps thru "start_a" to "end_a" at an increment of "inc_a"
	if increment = 0, only the start value will be used, and only once.

line 3:
	n_subj	n_pairs	start_a	 end_a	inc_a

	n_subj:  the number of different subjects, defined by new within
	hemisphere connections.  thus, n_subj lines will follow line 3 in
	this .in file.
	n_pairs:  the number of pairs of stimuli presented.  i.e., the number
	of pethi* files used

other:
	lines 4 through "end" contain the connection strengths for the
	13 different connections we are changing for each subject in the right
	hemisphere

	the 13 connections are as such:
	efd1->efd2, efd1->exfr, efd2->efd1, ev1h->ev4c, ev1h->ev4h, 
	ev1v->ev4c, ev1v->ev4v, ev4c->exss, ev4h->exss, ev4v->exss, 
	exfs->efd2, exfs->exfr, exss->exfs
