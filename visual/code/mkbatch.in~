line 1:
	name of the executable to generate .w files (netgen1 or netgenC)
line 2:
	where you want to store the data after the run is finished
line 3: nsubj,  cleanup, m,	ggns_in, see
	nsubj:  nsubj = 1, if we want to use the same subject for all attention
		  levels, i.e. we generate the weight files only once
		nsubj = any number > 1, each attention level correspond 
		   to a different subject. We regenerate the connections and
		   weights for every subject
		nsubj = 0, we do not want to generate the weights even once.
		  for example, if we run the dRnL case. Now we want to
		  see how the same subject respond to fRnL case. So when we
		  start the fRnL batch, we do not want to regenerate weights.
	cleanup: if cleanup = 0, we will not remove weight files at end
		 of the batch so that the next batch can use the same weights,
		 i.e. same subject as the previous batch.
	m: number of input files in .rs file
	ggns_in: the number of "on" blocks in the left brain's ggns input.  
	seed: The code mkinput  will use this number to randomly select 
	       which block is turned on. If seed = 0, system clock is the seed
line 4: lefthi, leftlo rightlo, start, end, incremen
	attention level parameters are:
	lefthi -- for left brain
	leftlo -- for left brain during intertrial period, if lefthi=leftlo, 
          left side has sustained attention
	rightlo-- for right brain during intertrial period
	righthi steps thru "start" to "end" at an increment of "increment"
	if increment = 0, only the start value will be used, and only once.

The attention levels are entered as integers.
e.g. if we want an attention level of 0.05, we enter 5.
This input will be converted to the proper unit in the code
We want integer entries because when we generate directory for a
subject with an attention level 0.05, we will name that directory b05.
It is necessary to keep the directory names to be of the same length
so we can use petmanip.m later for data manipulation
