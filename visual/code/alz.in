define "on" (which is 1) as having sick neurons, and "off(0) as not 
having sick neurons

line 1:
	seed for random number generator
		       	       if seed = 0, system clock is the default seed
line 2:
	left hemiphere on/off, right hemisphere on/off
line 3:
	exictatory units on/off, inhibitory units on/off
line 4 and up:
	region[1]on/off, .......region[10]on/off for the "on" regions only
----------------------------------------------
if both hemispheres are involved, and both excitatory and inhibitory units
 have sick neurons.  line 2 and line 3 of the input file would have:
1  1  ==> indicating hemisphere[0] (left) on, and hemisphere right on.
          if only left hemisphere on, this line would be 1 0
1  1  ==> indicating excitatory units on, and inhibitory units on
then the next four lines are a sequence of 0's and 1's, representing
left-excitatory regions
left-inhibitory regions
right-excitatory regions
right-inhibitory regions

ex. for left-excitatory regions:
0  1  1  0  1  1  1  0  0  0
which means regions 1,2,4,5,6 have sick excitatory neurons.
For the labels of each region, see end of this file

if only left hemispohere is on, and only the excitatory units are on, the
input from line 2 downward would look like:
1  0
1  0
0  1  1  0  1  1  1  0  0  0

 right side regions :
     ev1h, ev1v, ev4h, ev4v, ev4c, exss, exfs, efd1, efd2, exfr,
     iv1h, iv1v, iv4h, iv4v, iv4c, inss, infs, ifd1, ifd2, infr ;

 left side regions : 
     eg1h, eg1v, eg4h, eg4v, eg4c, exgt, egfs, egd1, egd2, egfr, 
     ig1h, ig1v, ig4h, ig4v, ig4c, ingt, igfs, igd1, igd2, igfr ;
