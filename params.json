{"name":"Large Scale Neural Model (LSNM)","tagline":"","body":"INTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe Large Scale Neural Model (LSNM) is a set of programs written in C and Matlab to simulate auditory and visual working memory experiments. The code was originally developed by Malle Tagamets and Barry Horwitz around 1997 to simulate a visual working memory experiment (see [[Tagamets and Horwitz, 1998|http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9651128]]) and later adapted/modified by Fatima Husain around 2000 to simulate an auditory working memory experiment (see [[Husain et al, 2004|http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15050592]]). The system was significantly expanded around 2003 by Theresa Long and Barry Horwitz by adding batch processing and by Brent Warner and Barry Horwitz by adding functional connectivity simulations (see [[Horwitz et al, 2005|http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16087450]]). Although the code was originally developed for simulating electrical neuronal activity and PET (Tagamets and Horwitz), extensions were added to the code to simulate fMRI (husain and Horwitz) and MEG (Feng Rong and Horwitz). The code to build a neuronal network and synaptic weights are written in C++ and the code to simulate (and display) PET, fMRI and MEG are written in Matlab.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the code described above, there were other branches of the code made over the years, such as the simulations of Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) around 2001 (see [[Husain et al, 2002|http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11771974]]),  the simulation of perceptual grouping around 2002 (see [[Husain et al, 2005|http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16197683]]), the simulations of long-duration auditory stimuli around 2003 (see [[Ulloa et al, 2008|http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19132798]]), and the simulation of a decision module around 2004 (see [[Wen et al, 2008|http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18496711]]).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
