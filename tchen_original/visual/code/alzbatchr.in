line 1:
	where you want to store the data after the run is finished
line 2: 
	m: number of trials in pethi.rs
	rightlo, 5 ==> 0.05 attention level
line 3:
start_p  end_p  inc_p  start_c  end_c  inc_c  start_a  end_a  inc_a

start value, end value, and increment
where suffix:
_p ==> percent neuron sick, e.g. 5 ==> 5% neuron sick
      note that percent < 99
_c ==> capacity of a sick neuron wrt to a health neuron, e.g. 40 ==> sick
       neuron has 40% activation of a healthy one
       note that capacity < 99
_a ==> attention level, 8 ==> attention level is 0.08
      note that attn < 50

All parameters are entered as integers.  They will be converted to proper
values in the code
if any of the inc's is 0, we do the start value only
