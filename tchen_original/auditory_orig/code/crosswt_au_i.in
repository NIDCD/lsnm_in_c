/* sample input if we want randomly generated connecition
1              1      y    50   
startregion ex_in  rangen  p     

startregion: a number in (1:4). states which region is the first region for
             non-homologous cross connection.  1=>a1, 2=>a2, 3=>STG,4=>PFC.
	     for example, if we don't want
             any connections to a1 from regions coming after A1 in the path
             we will enter 1 so that only A2,STG, PFC will have non-homologous
             connection
ex_in: 1 or 2, 1=>excitatory connection only, 2=>excitatory and inhibitory
rangen: y for random connection, n for specified connection
p:  % of nonhomologous connection (0-100), i.e. 0.5 probability is 50%
   so we enter 50 here 

note that seed for the random number generator has been removed from
this input file and became a command line input  
                seed: for random number, 0=>sys clock is default

 where line i+1 is the list of destination nodes from source i
if we enter 0 for line i, no connection

The above is for excitatory to excitatory connections.  If we want include 
inhibitory nodes too, then the destination line for each node is replaced
with 4 lines. The 1st line is excitatory-excitatory. The 2nd line is
excitatory-inhibitory. The 3rd line is inhibitory-excitatory.
The 4th line is inhibitory-inhibitory
