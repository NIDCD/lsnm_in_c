Subdirectories within the "lsnm" repository:

* auditory: 

Software that simulates auditory working memory during a delay match to sample task. It includes batch processing written in Unix bash and C++ to simulate multi-trial and multi-subject experiments, as well as matlab scripts for input generation and post-processing / visualization of output data.

* visual: 

Software that simulates visual working memory during a delay match to sample task. It includes batch processing written in Unix bash and C++ to simualte multi-trial and multi-subject experiments, as well as matlab scrpits for input generation and post-processing / visualization of output data.

* documents: 

Documents that describe the theory and implementation of LSNM.
