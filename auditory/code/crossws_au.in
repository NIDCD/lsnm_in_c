where
seed: for random number, if seed = 0, sys clock is default
perc: percent zero connection, in normalized form, i.e. 50% is 0.5
	note that the greater this number, the sparser the fanout is filled
fanr: number of rows for fanout
fanc: number of columns for fanout
base: base weight
scale: weight = base+-scale

The 2nd line is specification for homologous connection, excit. to excit.
The 3rd line is specification for nonhomologous connection excit. to excit.
weights for other connections (e.g. excit. to inh.) will be computed
in the code according to the weight ratio in the basic unit connection
