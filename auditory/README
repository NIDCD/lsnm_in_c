1. 	CHECKING DIRECTORY STRUCTURE

In home directory (where you want to run the sim), ensure that the
following directories exist and contain these file types.

	dir:  /bin
	file types:  Contains all of the executable programs.  When a program
	is compiled in the /code directory it is placed here.  If you are
	setting up the simulation for the first time, this directory should
	be empty.  For simulations after the first one, unless a change is
	made to the C code, these files will not be altered.

	dir:  /code
	file types:  *.cc and corresponding *.in files, makefile
	Contains all of the C code for the simulation, including batch jobs.  
	Most of the *.cc files have a *.in file that goes along with them
	and specifies several parameters that can be altered from sim to sim.

		subdir:  /netgen
		file types:  *.cc, *.h, *.o, makefile
		Contains the code for the network generator that creates all
		of the region-region connections within a hemisphere.  Has its
		own makefile.

		subdir:  /sim
		file types:  *.cc, *.h, *.o, makefile
		Contains the code for the actual simulation program.  Has its
		own makefile as well.

		subdir: /input_generation
		contains matlab scripts for generating input stimuli.

		subdir: /postprocessing
		contains matlab scripts for processing output data generated
		by the simulation, for example, PET, fMRI, and MEG generation.

		subdir: /visualization
		contains matlab scripts for visualizing output data.

	dir:  /inputs
	file types: *.inp, *.rs*
	*.inp files are the actual inputs to the model.  They specify which
	nodes in the inputs regions (MGNs and GMGN) are turned on.  *.rs files
	are the sequence files...i.e. the order in which inputs occur,
	switching from high to low attention, resets, etc.

	dir:  /sfiles
	file types:  *.s
	*.s files are sort of like inputs.  They are responsible for switching
	between high and low attention and resetting the system.

	dir:  /weights
	file types:  *.ws
		subdir:  /cross
		*.ws files are "weight" files that specify the connections
		between regions.  This directory contains the *.ws file for 
		EVERY possible left-right and right-left connection.  Note
		that not every one is used in every run....the ones used
		are chosen at random by the simulation unless it is set that
		all are used.  These *.ws files can be regenerated using
		the crossws_au program.
		subdir:  /left, /right
		Contains the *.ws files for that hemisphere's within-
		hemisphere connection made, both excitatory and inhibitory.

Once all of this setup has been done once, it does not need to be done again.


2.	SETTING THE ENVIRONMENT PATH VARIABLE $LSNM
 
To set up the path of the directory of LSNM, you need to add the following 
lines to your .bash_profile:

      LSNM=$HOME/location/of/LSNM/files/auditory

      export LSNM


The first time you set that up you will need to force linux to read the 
.bash_profile and upload it to memory by doing the following:

      $ source .bash_profile

You do not need to do that again because linux will read the .bash_profile 
everytime you log in and upload the variables contained there into memory.

The code uses the environmental variable LSNM to locate the working directory
for input/output of simulations, as well as for finding the executables.


3.	MAKING THE NECESSARY PROGRAMS

Each batch job runs a number of the same programs which must be made so that
they exist in your /bin.  

in /code:

$ make altgenw_au, 
$ make altgenw_L_au
$ make crossws_au
$ make crosswt_au_i
$ make genw_au
$ make mkattn_au

in /code/netgen:

make netgenC_au
make netgenC_L_au

in /code/sim:

make au_sim1

Note that there are other programs (*.cc files) that exist in these
directories.  These are others will be made when they are necessary.


4.	RUNNING A SIMULATION

The simulations are all run in a batch format, meaning that several simulations
are run using varying parameters to represent multiple subjects, inputs,
attention levels, region connections, etc.  The batches that I have used are:

mkbatchr_au.cc -- Right hemisphere only.  Can alter attention level and one
	region-region connection (usually STG->FS, but can be changed in
	genw.in)
	Uses pethir.rs for sequence file
mkbatchw_au.cc -- Both R and L hemispheres.  R receives form input, L receives
	noise.  Can alter attention levels and one region-region connection as
	in above.
	Uses pethi.rsn for sequence file (currently)
mkbatchb_au.cc -- Same as mkbatchw, except now allows user to change
	connection strengths for multiple region-region connections in RIGHT
	HEMISPHERE ONLY.  Additionally, cross-hemisphere connections are 
	regenerated for each trial.
	Uses auseq1.rsb, auseq2.rsb,... for sequence files (number corresponds
	to total number of trials)
mkbatchrlc_au.cc -- Essentially like mkbatchb_au, except the left and right
	hemispheres have been combined into one large hemisphere with half
	specific neurons (old right) that are task-dedicated and half 
	non-specific neurons (old left) that are "distracted".  The only real
	difference from mkbatchb is that now any alterations of connection
	strength in the specific (right) are mirrored in the non-specific 
	(left).  Before, the left hemisphere connections remained constant.
	Uses same sequence files as mkbatchb_au.

Each of these has a *.in file to go along with it.  Before running one, check
*.in file and set the desired values.  This file will specify many parameters,
which are explained in the actual file.  Also, you should change the sequence
file(s) that particular batch uses to reflect the organization of inputs you
want.

TO ACTUALLY RUN THE SIMULATION (using mkbatchb_au as an example)

go the the /code directory and use the following command sequence.

$ make mkbatchb_au	        -- makes the executable in the /bin
$ cd ..
$ ./bin/mkbatchb_au		-- runs the executable to produce the batchfile,
$ ./batchb_au			-- runs the batch

All of the output files from the batch will be placed in the directory
specified in line 1 of the corresponding *.in file.

5.	SOME OTHER USEFUL PROGRAMS

C PROGRAMS:
The mkbatchb_au and mkbatchrlc_au versions have a sequence file for each trial
that is done.  Thus, the output files are split up trial-by-trial.  Since it
is useful to see all of the trials at once when analyzing the data, there is a
program that combines them called mkcatout.cc

mkcatout_au is run similarly to the batch jobs.  Go to its *.in file, change
the necessary parameters outlined there (make sure the output directory is set)
and use the following sequence of commands while in /code.

$ make mkcatout_au
$ ../bin/mkcatout_au
$ catout_au

Depending on the number of subjects/attention level/trials, this program can
take quite awhile.  It traverses all of the output directories, unzips the
files, concatenates them for a subject/attn level, places the new files in the
attention level directory (/b30 for example), and then rezips everything.

MATLAB PROGRAMS:
There are several useful matlab programs for visualizing output.  All of these
are currently located in code/visualization.  Make sure this is
added to you matlab path (or copy them over to your directory and add that
path).  Note that each of these programs only work on the files in the
current directory.

	loadmovieB_au — creates a movie of the output. Left hemisphere
 	regions are on the top row, right on the bottom. The order in both
	from left to right is: MGN, A1, A2, STG, FS, D1, D2, FR


	plotauditory — plots the electrical activity for the right hemisphere.
	pre-STG units are on figure 1, STG-PFC are on figure 2.

	plot_audleft — same as above but left hemisphere.

	plotaud_rl — plots the homologous left and right hemisphere regions on
	top of each other on the same plot to represent a combined hemisphere.
	Used with mkbatchrlc_au.cc

	maketopo — useful when you would like to see the shape of your inputs.
	Run this and then plot mgns or gmgn.
